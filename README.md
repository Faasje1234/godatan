# Godatan

Catan gameplay in Godot 4.
Online version in: https://vokimon.github.io/godatan/

This is just a personal exercise to learn how to code board games in Godot4,
and not a playable version of Settlers of Catan.

There are other ways to play Settlers of Catan.
I would recommend one of the best opensource implementations, [Pioners],
or the official propietary digital version [Catan Universe].

## Running from sources

Debian/Ubuntu currently provides as off-the-shelf deb package Godot LTS version 3.5 but this game requires Godot 4.2.
My recommendation is to [download the Linux static binary](https://godotengine.org/),
uncompres, make it executable and move in you local user path (`~/.local/bin`?).

To run just call godot from the project directory.
To edit pass the `project.godot` file as paramenter.

## License

This software is licensed under GNU Affero GPL License v3 or later.
More detais in the [license](LICENSE)

The Affero licence implies that even if someone serves this game
through a server, the users should have the right to access the code, 
including any modification made, with the same original rights and obligations.

IMHO, it is fair to have a fee for using a hosted service based on freesoftware,
but it is not fair to close free software,
not giving back modifications to the community
or not crediting the authors.
