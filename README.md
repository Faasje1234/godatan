Catan gameplay in Godot 4.
Online version in: https://vokimon.github.io/godatan/

This is just a personal exercise to learn how to code board games in Godot4,
and not a playable version of Settlers of Catan.

There are other ways to play Settlers of Catan.
I would recommend one of the best opensource implementations, [Pioners],
or the official propietary digital version [Catan Universe].
